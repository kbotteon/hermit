== Introduction

HERMIT is a collection of silicon and software source code for an electronics multi-tool, targeting FPGA development boards.

This is a fun hardware software co-design weekend project, and to call it a "Work in Progress" is an understatement.

== Architecture

== Getting Started

Add a udev rule in `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-picoprobe.rules` or a similar file name.

----
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2e8a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="000c", ENV{ID_SERIAL_SHORT}=="E660C06213257929", MODE:="0666", SYMLINK+="picoprobe-7929"
----

Change the serial number and symlink to match that of your picoprobe.
